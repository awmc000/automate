1. `True` and `False`.
2. `and`, `or`, `not`.
3. skip, very familiar w/ these
4. False, True, True, False, False, True
5. ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=
6. `==` checks equality, `=` does assignment.
7. A condition is a statement that must be true for something to happen,
and they come up all the time in programming as we want the program to behave differently for different inputs or contexts.
11. `break` exits the loop entirely, `continue` jumps to the condition check.
12. These produce the same list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], but the first one specifies only the  upper bound, 
the second also includes the starting number, and the third also includes the increment.
